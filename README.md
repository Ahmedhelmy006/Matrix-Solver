# Matrix-Solver
Solving any n by m Matrices by using Gaussian Elimination in O(N + M) time using staircase Algorithm. Matrix solver also features more intersting operations on matrices such as Transposing, Inverting, Multiplying and Addition. This is a practical application of my studies in linear Algebra over the past few months.
